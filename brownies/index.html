                <h2 class="section-heading">Hello, Brownies</h2>
                <p>
                    I decided that I would be testing out some recipes from my new cookbook from The King Arthur Flour Company. I told my coworker Bear that I would bring him some brownies this weekend, so I set out on my mission to produce said brownies. This is the first time I've made brownies without a boxed mix. I don't think I'll ever go back to using boxed mixes for my baked goods. Not when I have fantastic recipes such as the one I followed here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First things first, we'll be needing an ingredients list:
                </p>

                <div class="side-by-side">
                    <ul class="left-side">
                        <li>6 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate</li>
                        <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                        <li>5 large eggs</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>2 1/2 cups sugar</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul class="right-side">
                        <li>1/3 cup light corn syrup (optional)</li>
                        <li>1 1/3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <span class="caption text-muted">Just enough butter to get by</span>

                <p>
                    First things first, we'll add the baking chocolate and the butter into a small pot on low heat.
                </p>

                <span class="caption text-muted">Can we get a little heat in here?</span>

                <span class="caption text-muted">Ahhh, that's more like it!</span>

                <p>
                    While the butter and chocolate are getting to know each-other, let's prepare the wet ingredients.
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/eggs.jpg" alt="Five eggs in a metal mixing bowl">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Thanks, Chickens.</span>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/vanilla.jpg" alt="2 teaspoons of vanilla extract">
                <span class="caption text-muted">A little vanilla goes a long way.</span>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/salt.jpg" alt="just a pinch of salt">
                <span class="caption text-muted">This picture is a little unnecessary, isn't it?</span>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/sugar.jpg" alt="two and a half cups of sugar in a metal bowl">
                <span class="caption text-muted">A kitchen scale is a wonderful thing!</span>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/light-corn-syrup.jpg" alt="light corn syrup in a metal bowl">
                <span class="caption text-muted">This stuff is optional. It'll keep them fresh for longer and make the brownies denser.</span>

                <p>
                    Have you got all of that? Well, what's next is a little combining...
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/all-together-now.jpg" alt="all the wet ingredients combined">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Just toss 'em all in there. Doesn't have to be pretty!</span>

                <p>
                    ...then a lot of mixing! Beat those ingredients together until they are combined and light and fluffy!
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wet-combined.jpg" alt="all of the wet ingredients beaten until light and fluffy">
                <span class="caption text-muted">I had a wooden spoon to work with. Use whatever tool you'd like!</span>

                <p>
                    Go ahead and preheat your oven to 375 degrees Farenheit and grease up your 9x13-inch pan.
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/set-oven-375.jpg" alt="setting oven to 375 degrees farenheit">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Is it just me, or is it getting hot in here?</span>

                <span class="caption text-muted">I might have gone a little overboard here...</span>

                <p>
                    Now then, all of your chocolate and butter are combined and melted, right? You took them off the heat once they were done and put off to the side? Excellent.
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/melted-chocolate.jpg" alt="melted chocolate">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Unless you like unsweetened chocolate, don't go dipping your fingers in this.</span>

                <p>
                    Now, we'll add the flour to the melted mixture stir it in.
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/chocolate-and-flour.jpg" alt="flour on top of melted chocolate">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Gotta love that tare functionality.</span>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/chocolate-and-flour-combined.jpg" alt="flour mixed into chocolate">
                <span class="caption text-muted">I promise you, this just tastes like bitter chocolate and flour. Not good eats.</span>

                <p>
                    Awesome. Now we're ready to combine this chocolate mixture with our wet ingredients we fluffed up earlier.
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/chocolate-in-egg-mixture.jpg" alt="chocolate mixture poured into wet ingredients">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Just scrape it all in.</span>

                <span class="caption text-muted">That's the stuff. If you can't wait until after pouring, now's the time to sneak a taste!</span>

                <p>
                    For a nice optional addition, go ahead and chop up some walnuts and stir them right on in.
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/chopped-walnuts.jpg" alt="chopped walnuts">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Don't go too crazy on them. Just a little choppin' is all you need.</span>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/walnuts-and-chocolate-combined.jpg" alt="chopped walnuts in batter">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Looking good!</span>

                <p>
                    Eating time is getting closer and closer! Pour that delicious batter into the greased pan and give that spoon a lick. You deserve it!
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/batter-in-baking-dish.jpg" alt="batter in baking dish">
                <span class="caption text-muted">The bubbles on top here are quite alright. Think of the texture the top of your brownies will be like!</span>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/taste-batter.jpg" alt="me tasting the brownie batter">
                <span class="caption text-muted">Pretty tasty! Selfies are hard, man...</span>

                <p>
                    Your oven should be plenty pre-heated by now. Throw that baking dish in on the middle rack and set yourself a timer for 35 minutes.
                </p>

                <span class="caption text-muted">Just 35 more minutes! Annnnd some cooling time.</span>

                <span class="caption text-muted">All done!</span>

                <p>
                    Thank you for following me through this. They came out fantastically. I hope you can make some yourself and enjoy some delicious home-made brownies too!
